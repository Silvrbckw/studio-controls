 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Fixes:

These things need to be looked for in 2.3.2
autojack
------------------8<--------------------
DONE for now
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/autojack", line 1829, in <module>
    main()
  File "/usr/bin/autojack", line 1789, in main
    phones_check()
  File "/usr/bin/autojack", line 1576, in phones_check
    dev_db = conf_db['devices'][dname]
KeyError: 'USB'
 - human user
 - Maybe unupdated config file
 - I think this has been solved by auto_jack.py
-----------------------------------------

IN Studio-controls:

FIXED
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/studio-controls", line 769, in check_jack_status
    load = control_iface.GetLoad()
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dbus/proxies.py", line 141, in __call__
    return self._connection.call_blocking(self._named_service,
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dbus/connection.py", line 652, in call_blocking
    reply_message = self.send_message_with_reply_and_block(
dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.jackaudio.Error.ServerNotRunning: Can't execute method 'GetLoad' with stopped JACK server
 - need to check and track jack status
 - Used direct query to jackdbus to check running
------------------8<--------------------
In general change all jack_client.* calls to jackdbus queries
------------------8<--------------------



TODO:
    - detect if pulse is pw
    - 

Future Features:
	- make help work with current tab
	- remove warning dialogs and create on the fly as needed
	- Add packagers file describing depends/conflicts
	- Add multiple devices for firewire
	- bluetooth via pulse. use: pacmd load-module module-loopback latency_msec=5
		and: pacmd unload-module module-loopback
		need to figue out how to auto route jack->pulse bridge to loop
		and loop to bt device.
        Note: not worth doing. Pipewire will do this for us.

	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
