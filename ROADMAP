 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Fixes:

TODO: (part way done)
	[GUI]
	- find false possitive for session changed

Future Features:
	- make help work with current tab
	- remove warning dialogs and create on the fly as needed
	- add JACK freeze detect and correct
	- better JACK status showing
		- detect xruns in autojack so number is for full jack run
		- keep xrun reason (log it?)

	- Add jackmixer  or jack-mix-box? auto start and connect
	- Add packagers file describing depends/conflicts
	- Add multiple devices for firewire
	- bluetooth via pulse. use: pacmd load-module module-loopback latency_msec=5
		and: pacmd unload-module module-loopback
		need to figue out how to auto route jack->pulse bridge to loop
		and loop to bt device.
	- add drawing tablet support
		- start listing xsetwacom and xsetpointer devices and allowing
		user to take pointers and add them to wacom devices (if possiblle)
		- add module that allows setting of display settings in tablets that
		have displays.
		- Then see if we can match plasma utility for setting size and 
		setting buttons etc.

	- add use of internals (net manager, audio and net adapters)
		option to use audioadapter instead of zita bridge?
		that may only work for one device, zita can do many.
	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
