 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)


TODO:
    - Assume pipewire is in system
    - detect if pulse is pw - use pw commands
    - choose system mode:
        - pulse/jack:
            same as before, turn pulse on, turn PW's jack lib off
            This will only last a while as pulse will go
        - pipewire only
            Use PW to replace both pulse and jack. Jack libs will point
            at PW. Maybe figure out use jackd as a device. (jack device switch)
        - pipewire/jack
            The idea is to use PW instead of pulse with jack still being
            used normally. Need to figure out pw-jack bridging

Useful info:
    - PW restart line: systemctl --user restart wireplumber pipewire pipewire-pulse

    - PW devices can be renamed in ~/.config/wireplumber/main.lua.d/
        sample file: 51-alsa-rename.lua
            rule = {
              matches = {
                {
                  { "node.name", "equals", "alsa_output.pci-0000_07_00.0.pro-output-0" },
                },
              },
              apply_properties = {
                ["node.description"] = "M66",
                ["node.nick"] = "M66",
              },
             }
            rule1 = {
              matches = {
                {
                  { "node.name", "equals", "alsa_input.pci-0000_07_00.0.pro-input-0" },
                },
              },
              apply_properties = {
                ["node.description"] = "M66",
                ["node.nick"] = "M66",
              },
            }
            
            table.insert(alsa_monitor.rules,rule)
            table.insert(alsa_monitor.rules,rule1)
            Notes: description = what desktop sees and jack sees in full mode
                    nick = what jack sees in short mode.

    - pw setting jack parameters is done in ~/.config/pipewire/jack.conf.d/
        I used a file called: studio.conf
            jack.properties = {
                node.latency = 512/48000
                #node.rate          = 1/48000 # is this right?
                node.lock-quantum = true #we want true
                node.force-quantum = 512 # this should match latency above
                jack.show-monitor  = false # default to off. The same
                                            # same audio is already available
                #jack.merge-monitor  = false # perhaps true would be right
                jack.short-name     = true # long names are painful
                jack.filter-name    = true # no bad char
                jack.filter-char    = "_" # space is bad
                #
                # allow:           Don't restrict self connect requests
                # fail-external:   Fail self connect requests to external ports only
                # ignore-external: Ignore self connect requests to external ports only
                # fail-all:        Fail all self connect requests
                # ignore-all:      Ignore all self connect requests
                #jack.self-connect-mode = allow
                #jack.locked-process    = true
                jack.default-as-system = true # true because old projects
                                            # that connect to system: work
                                            # Hmm maybe false, change name
                                            # with wireplumber
                #jack.fix-midi-events   = true # change note on v0 to note off

        Setting rate may not work as above and note that most of the above
        parameters can be changed on the fly. pipewire.conf does have a
        default SR. but the jack page suggests using:
            pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.force-rate <samplerate>
            pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.force-quantum <buffersize>
        Need to find out how to set jack master and desktop default to
        be different.
        Many of these things can be set on the fly, so set the param on the
        fly so we don't restart PW but still write the file for next start.

    - pw mode should replace pulse bridge with a loopback node(s):
        ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/11-loopback.conf
        context.modules = [
            {   name = libpipewire-module-loopback
                args = {
                    audio.position = [ FL FR ]
                    capture.props = {
                        media.class = Audio/Sink
                        node.name = loop_sink
                        node.description = "loop-sink"
                        #node.latency = 1024/48000
                        #audio.rate = 44100
                        #audio.channels = 2
                        #audio.position = [ FL FR ]
                        #target.object = "my-default-sink"
                    }
                    playback.props = {
                        #media.class = Audio/Source
                        node.name = loop_source
                        node.description = "loop-source"
                        #node.latency = 1024/48000
                        #audio.rate = 44100
                        #audio.channels = 2
                        #audio.position = [ FL FR ]
                        target.object = "my-default-source"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
        - NOTE there may be different/better ways. See virtual devices

    -pw device name changes etc can replace extra devices. "Extra devices"
        should be changed "device setup"
    -Session management can remain as is. Code may be different.
    - network can remain as is using zita-njbridge
        this may be a problem... zita-njbridge was crashing.



Future Features:
	- make help work with current tab
	- remove warning dialogs and create on the fly as needed
	- Add packagers file describing depends/conflicts
	- Add multiple devices for firewire
	- bluetooth via pulse. 
        Note: not worth doing. Pipewire will do this for us.
        use: pacmd load-module module-loopback latency_msec=5
		and: pacmd unload-module module-loopback
		need to figue out how to auto route jack->pulse bridge to loop
		and loop to bt device.


	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
