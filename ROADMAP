 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Fixes:

These things need to be looked for in 2.3.3



TODO:
    - detect if pulse is pw
    - 

Future Features:
	- make help work with current tab
	- remove warning dialogs and create on the fly as needed
	- Add packagers file describing depends/conflicts
	- Add multiple devices for firewire
	- bluetooth via pulse. use: pacmd load-module module-loopback latency_msec=5
		and: pacmd unload-module module-loopback
		need to figue out how to auto route jack->pulse bridge to loop
		and loop to bt device.
        Note: not worth doing. Pipewire will do this for us.


	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
