 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Fixes:
autojack

Traceback (most recent call last):

    new_l = phone_port
NameError: name 'phone_port' is not defined
 - phone_port is global, make sure it is something at startup
 - check for not none before using

 - this should have been moved to auto_jack.py
 - expanduser problem? print file name maybe first line as well?

 - use try/except? line splitting? works here though.

 - file read problem, check file name and length. maybe studio-controls
	has not finished writing? maybe auto_jack.py has not?
 - do we need a lockfile?

TODO:
    - detect if pulse is pw
    - 

Future Features:
	- make help work with current tab
	- remove warning dialogs and create on the fly as needed
	- Add packagers file describing depends/conflicts
	- Add multiple devices for firewire
	- bluetooth via pulse. use: pacmd load-module module-loopback latency_msec=5
		and: pacmd unload-module module-loopback
		need to figue out how to auto route jack->pulse bridge to loop
		and loop to bt device.
        Note: not worth doing. Pipewire will do this for us.

	- remove Cadence from autostart and Cadences pulseaudio config
		Cadence will reinsert these if the user decides to use it again
		but at least if controls is used PA should get set to stock.
		Will also have to restart PA as Cadence disables respawn so
		one start is needed to re-enable that.
	- adding in stuff from https://github.com/jhernberg/udev-rtirq so that
		hot plugged USB devices get higher priority.
