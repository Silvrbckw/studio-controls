<h1>Audio Setup - Extra Devices</h1>
<p>
	The <strong>Extra Devices</strong> tab allows other audio devices in the system
	to show up as JACK clients and be used by JACK applications. These bridges are
	created using zita-ajbridge a light weight but high quality bridge. These
	bridges use resampling to make sure the audio is in sync with the master
	audio device.
</p>
<p>
	Studio Controls keeps it's own database of devices, it includes both devices
	Studio Controls can see in the system as well as devices that have been plugged
	before. This tab sets up what autojack will do when it detect these devices are
	present.

<p>
	The <strong>Select Device to Edit</strong> drop down chooses the device the settings
	in this tab apply to.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong>Hide This Device</strong> check box will tell autojack to ignore this device.
	It will also keep this device from showing up in the JACK master drop downs.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>JACK Base Name</strong> Is the base part of the name that will be used for an
	extra device bridge for this device. An -in or -out will be added to this to keep all
	JACK client names unique.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong>Sample Rate</strong>, <strong>Buffer Size</strong> and <strong>Number of periods</strong>
	are the same as for JACK master. The device may not work at the same rate, buffer size or
	number of periods as JACK master, that is ok. Zita-ajbridge can deal with the difference.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Studio Controls tries to find the range of sample rates a device supports.
	However, more rates may be displayed than are supported for some devices.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Capture</strong> and <strong>Playback</strong> ports is the number of ports that should be
	created for input or output bridges. A port count of zero is the same as off or not used. A number
	greater than the available ports on the device will use the maximum number of ports available.
</p>
<p>
	In some cases it is helpful if USB devices will just show as a JACK client without setup
	ahead of time. There are two checkboxes that control this:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Bridge USB Devices to JACK When Plugged In</strong> Auto bridges any unknown USB device
	when it is plugged in. If the user has set this device to zero ports or has hidden the device,
	it will not be auto connected.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>USB device bridge is input only</strong> is used for USB devices that are input only but
	are detected to also have outputs and create extra noise when opened as an output as well.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Headphones</strong> can sometimes be detected by the system if they are motherboard
	headphones or USB headphones. Three settings are available for headphones:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Switch</strong> will switch the main outputs to the phone device</li>
			<li><strong>User Script</strong> will run a user supplied script ~/.config/autojack/headphone
				<em>plugged</em>, where plugged is either "True" or "False"</li>
			<li><strong>No Action</strong> will do nothing</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><strong>Device</strong> is the device headphones are (or will be) connected to. If the headphones
	are USB headphones then they need to have been plugged in at some time in order for that device
	to show up on the list</li>
	<li><strong>Manual Headphones/Speaker Switch</strong> is for headphone devices that cannot be
	auto detected. The main outputs will be switched between <strong>Main Output Ports</strong>
	and the <strong>Headphone Device</strong></li>
</ul>
