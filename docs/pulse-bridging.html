<h1>Audio Setup - Pulse Bridging</h1>
<p>
	For most Linux desktops, Pulseaudio is the desktop audio server and many desktop
	applications talk directly to Pulseaudio. JACK will take exclusive access to any
	device it uses as master to ensure no other application changes it's sample rate or
	interferes with the audio in some other way. The utility used for bridging extra
	devices also takes exclusive access of the device it uses.
	So for desktop applications to have audio while the JACK audio server is running
	Pulseaudio needs to be bridged to JACK. In this way, JACK acts as the "device"
	for Pulseaudio.
</p>
<p>
	It has been found that when Pulseaudio is bridged to JACK it will cause interference
	if it can still see any audio hardware and so before bridging, Studio Controls will
	disable any ALSA modules in Pulseaudio making JACK the only audio "device" Pulseaudio
	sees.
</p>
<p>
	Studio Controls can set up any number of pulse->JACK bridges with any number of channels.

	This screen consists of these controls:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bridge to Configure</strong> is a drop down that lists all the Pulse output
	bridges the user has configured. This is used to select the output bridge to edit.</li>
	<li><strong>Bridge Name</strong> allows changing the name of the bridge to something
	that better describes that bridge. The name must be unique out of all JACK clients
	or the auto connections will not work. Names should not have spaces or other characters
	that have special meaning on the command line.</li>
	<li><strong>Bridge Channel Count</strong> is the number of channels this bridge should
	have. The channels will be labeled as 3d appropriate names</li>
	<li><strong>Auto Connect Port</strong> is the first of channel count ports that this
	bridge should connect to. Connections are made starting at this port and continuing
	to channel count or the last device port which ever is less.</li>
	<li><strong>Add A New Bridge</strong> will add another Pulse to JACK bridge with
	the default name pulse<code>num</code>_<code>dirrection</code> where <code>num</code> is the first number
	that makes the JACK client name unique and <code>dirrection</code> is in or out depending
	on the direction chosen. The new bridge will default to two channels
	and no auto connections.</li>
	<li><strong>Remove Output Bridge</strong> will remove the bridge displayed.</li>
</ul>
