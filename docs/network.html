<h1>Audio And MIDI Networking</h1>
<p>
	Studio Controls uses the excellent zita-njbridge for audio networking. This has proven to be
	a stable and easy to set up way of doing things. It can be set up and running on one computer
	while the other is shut down with no problems. It is the most like a patch cable in operation.
</p>
<p>
	NOTE: a network bridge needs to be set up on each end, it can not be done all on one computer.
</p>
<p>
	Select the <strong>Bridge to Edit</strong> with the drop down list. The name of the bridge
	as it will show in JACK can be edited with the <strong>Bridge Name</strong> entry box.
	The <strong>Audio Direction</strong> is an indication of what direction this bridge is.
	<strong>Channel count</strong> is the number of channels and can be from 1 to 64. The
	<strong>Add Network Bridge</strong> dropdown allows adding either an output or an input bridge.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong>Bridge receiver IP</strong> will be filled in automatically on the receiver end but
	only the network part will be filled in on the sender. The user needs to finish this address off
	to match the receiver IP. The <strong>Bridge Receiver Port</strong> should likewise be the same
	on both machines. Also note that ports for more than one bridge should be separated by more than one
	port number. (it may be easiest to put them 10 apart)
</p>
<p>
	The Sender may send the data as 16 bit integers, 24 bit integers or 32 bit float. Use the smallest
	bit depth that will do the job. If the bridge is to be connected at one end only to an audio output
	device, 16bit integer will work well. If one end will only be connected to an audio input device,
	24 bit integer will work well. If on board processing will be done with the signal at both ends
	(for example a remote synth), 32 bit float is a good choice. Lower bit depth will use less
	network bandwidth and be less likely to suffer dropouts. The bit depth can only be set at the
	sending end and the receiver will receive either.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong>Receiver Latency</strong> is set in ms and can be set longer to improve stability
	if needed.
</p>
<h1>MIDI networking</h1>
<p>
	MIDI networking uses qmidinet which uses the ipmidi method of MIDI transfer. There are ipmidi
	utilities for both macos and windows as well.
</p>
<p>
	Setting 0 channels turns this off. The type selector allows the midi ports to be either JACK
	or ALSA MIDI ports.
