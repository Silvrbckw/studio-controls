<h2>Obtaining Studio Controls</h2>
<p>
Your distribution may already have a package you can install. Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch are known
to have a package.
</p>
<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>
Studio Controls is installed in <a href="https://ubuntustudio.org">Ubuntu Studio</a> by default.
Prior to 20.10, Studio Controls was known as Ubuntu Studio Controls. The version covered in this
page is only part of Ubuntu Studio 20.10 and higher, or any supported Ubuntu Studio version with
the backports PPA.
</p>
<p>
To obtain this newest version, add the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/BackportsPPA">
Ubuntu Studio Backports PPA</a>
</p>
<p>
If you are running a different official flavor of Ubuntu than Ubuntu Studio, Studio Controls
installs with the Ubuntu Studio Installer.
</p>
<p>
If not already installed, open a terminal and type:
<br>
<code>sudo apt install studio-controls</code>
</p>
<h3>Fedora</h3>
<p>
Studio Controls is installed in <a href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/jam/">Fedora Jam</a>
(33 and higher) by default and is available in Fedora 31 and higher.
</p>
<p>
To install, open a terminal and type:<br>
<code>sudo dnf install studio-controls</code>
</p>
<h3>Tar Ball Package</h3>
<p>
A tarball or zipped package can be downloaded from
<a href="https://github.com/ovenwerks/studio-controls/releases">GitHub.</a>
</p>
<p>
To install:
<ol>
<li>open a terminal</li>
<li>cd to the directory where the package was downloaded to</li>
<li>extract the contents of the tar ball</li>
<li>cd into the directory the extraction created</li>
<li>type:<br>
<code>sudo make install</code></li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Using Studio Controls</h2>
<p>
For many people the use of Studio Controls is straight forward.
However, if JACK is new to you or you want to go deeper, there is an online
<a href="manual.html"><strong>manual</strong>.</a>
</p>
<h3>Warning!</h3>
<p>If Cadence (another program that controls JACK) has been used on your system
(even if you have removed it) Studio Controls may not work for you. Cadence adds system
files that removing the software does not remove. These files will interfere with
running Studio Controls. In particular, PulseAudio may no longer work correctly.</p>
<h3>Bugs?</h3>
<p>Well we hope not but there probably are.</p>
<p>
Bugs and feature requests should be submitted to
<a href="https://github.com/ovenwerks/studio-controls/issues" name="github">issues.</a>
</p>
<h3>Support the project</h3>
<p>Bug reports, feature requests and comments are probably the best support we could ask for. However,
financial support would also be welcome. This would be used to buy hardware needed for further testing.
For example to buy a USB 2.0 audio device. I have currently done all testing with cheap (under $10)
USB 1.1 devices. Firewire support has only been made possible by the kind donation of a firewire device.</p>
